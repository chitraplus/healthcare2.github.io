</strong><br>Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your body doesn’t make or use the hormone insulin properly. It causes too much blood glucose (sugar) to build up in the blood. There are 2 main types of diabetes.
<br>
<br>Type 1 diabetes occurs when your body doesn’t produce any insulin. It’s sometimes called juvenile diabetes because it’s usually discovered in children and teenagers, but it may appear in adults, too.
<br>
<br>Type 2 diabetes occurs when your body doesn’t produce enough insulin or doesn’t use the insulin as it should. In the past, doctors thought only adults were at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. However, an increasing number of children in the United States are now being diagnosed with the disease. Doctors think this increase is mostly because more children are overweight or obese and are less physically active.
<br>
<br>Prediabetes occurs when blood sugar levels are higher than they should be, but not high enough to officially be diagnosed as diabetes. Pre-diabetes greatly increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The good news is that, if you have prediabetes, you can prevent or delay the onset of full-blown type 2 diabetes by making lifestyle changes. These include eating a healthy diet, reaching and maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising regularly.<br><br><strong>Symptoms of diabetes -</strong><br>Symptoms vary from person to person. The early stages of diabetes have very few symptoms. You may not know you have the disease. But damage may already be happening to your eyes, your kidneys, and your cardiovascular system. Common symptoms include:
<br>• Extreme hunger.
<br>• Extreme thirst.
<br>• Frequent urination.
<br>• Unexplained weight loss.
<br>• Fatigue or drowsiness.
<br>• Blurry vision.
<br>• Slow-healing wounds, sores, or bruises.
<br>• Dry, itchy skin.
<br>• Tingling or numbness in the hands or feet.
<br>• Frequent or recurring skin, gum, bladder, or vaginal yeast infections.<br>
<br>People who have type 2 diabetes also may show signs of insulin resistance. This includes darkening skin around the neck or in the armpits, high blood pressure, cholesterol problems, yeast infections, and skipped or absent periods in teen girls and women.<br><br><strong>What are the different types of diabetes?
</strong><br>The most common types of diabetes are type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes.
<br>
<br><strong>Type 1 diabetes
</strong><br>If you have type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. Your immune system attacks and destroys the cells in your pancreas that make insulin. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, although it can appear at any age. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to stay alive.
<br>
<br><strong>Type 2 diabetes
</strong><br>If you have type 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insulin well. You can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood. However, this type of diabetes occurs most often in middle-aged and older people. Type 2 is the most common type of diabetes.
<br>
<br><strong>Gestational diabetes
</strong><br>Gestational diabetes develops in some women when they are pregnant. Most of the time, this type of diabetes goes away after the baby is born. However, if you’ve had gestational diabetes, you have a greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Sometimes diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy is actually type 2 diabetes.<br><br><strong>What causes type 1 diabetes?
</strong><br>Type 1 diabetes occurs when your immune system, the body’s system for fighting infection, attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. Scientists think type 1 diabetes is caused by genes and environmental factors, such as viruses, that might trigger the disease.&nbsp;<br>
<br><strong>What causes type 2 diabetes?
</strong><br>Type 2 diabetes—the most common form of diabetes—is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes.
<br>
<br>Overweight, obesity, and physical inactivity
<br>You are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you are not physically active and are overweight or obese. Extra weight sometimes causes insulin resistance and is common in people with type 2 diabetes. The location of body fat also makes a difference. Extra belly fat is linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and heart and blood vessel disease. To see if your weight puts you at risk for type 2 diabetes, check out these Body Mass Index (BMI) charts.
<br><br>Type 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistance, a condition in which muscle, liver, and fat cells do not use insulin well. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells. At first, the pancreas makes more insulin to keep up with the added demand. Over time, the pancreas can’t make enough insulin, and blood glucose levels rise.<br><br><strong>Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes<br></strong>You are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you<br>are overweight or obese
<br>• are age 45 or older
<br>• have a family history of diabetes
<br>• are African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander
<br>• have high blood pressure
<br>• have a low level of HDL (“good”) cholesterol, or a high level of triglycerides
<br>• have a history of gestational diabetes or gave birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more
<br>• are not physically active
<br>• have a history of heart disease or stroke
<br>• have depression NIH external link
<br>• have polycystic ovary syndrome<br>• have acanthosis nigricans—dark, thick, and velvety skin around your neck or armpits<br><br><strong>What health problems can people with diabetes develop?
</strong><br>Over time, high blood glucose leads to problems such as
<br>• heart disease
<br>• stroke
<br>• kidney disease
<br>• eye problems
<br>• dental disease
<br>• nerve damage
<br>• foot problems
<br>You can take steps to lower your chances of developing these diabetes-related health problems.<br></p>
